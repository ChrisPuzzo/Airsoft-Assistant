# Battle Assistant App
This app is intended to be an open-source assistant to IRL shooter games such as airsoft, nerf, or paintball.

It is very much still in development and is being soley designed by me, so it might take some time to get out a full builf of it.

## Purposed Features

I envision this app being used in two ways: Self-hosted for free or payed internet hosting. The plan is to initilaly develop a self hosting system, then see if there is interest into a paid hosting version

### Basic Features

- The ability to create and save users to either a SQLlite or MySQL database
  - Tracks user statistics
  - Allows user to view other players saved on the system
- Having several preset game modes to play
- A way to create custom games

### Advanced Features

- An AI that can predict the outcome/betting odds of a game
